# Triple Optimum Blocks
Note, currently making 1 Article block, then will build from there.

A collection of blocks, starting from 1 that needs recoding, that will be:
1. Plug-and-play.
2. Coded in ES6 (overall ES next) using @wordpress/scripts.
3. Performant, with lean backend and frontend includes, fully contained, non-coliding CSS, so forth.

Initial blocks:
1. Refactored inital block will move from card style to a Wood Block mimic.
2. Second block will be a "signature" style block overlaying on an image or background.
3. As looking at adding better UI to blocks overall and an improved Image block.
